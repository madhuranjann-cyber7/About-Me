# 👋 Hi, I’m Madhuranjan Kumar Shukla  

Hi, I’m Madhuranjan Kumar Shukla — your friendly neighborhood **Master Data Analyst, AI Enthusiast, and Prompt Engineer**. Some say I’m also a **motivator and a great friend**; I like to think I’m just someone who knows how to make **data (and people) feel understood**. I’m based in **Hyderabad, India**, currently working with **TCS, Thane - Maharashtra**, and before that, I had stints at **Verisys Global and Thomson Reuters India**, both in Hyderabad.

My expertise? Think of me as the Swiss Army knife for **Supply Chain Management and SAP Material Management Module**. I craft technical **documents, SOPs, job aids, work instructions**, and even design those “master forms” nobody loves to fill but everybody needs. With **8 years** of hands-on **SAP ERP experience**, I’ve mastered the interface so well that sometimes it feels like it should be paying me rent.

Now, here’s the twist — **I’m not from a traditional IT background**. Yet, my **curiosity** for the **tech side** has always been sky-high. I tinker with my **WordPress website, upload experiments to GitHub, and occasionally lose track of time while deep-diving into prompt engineering or coding**.

In my so-called “free time,” **you’ll find me at the gym**, refining my **resume-building skills**, or having spirited conversations with friends about… well, anything under the sun. My life motto? **Never stop learning — because the moment you do, life gets boring, and boring is not on my to-do list**..
